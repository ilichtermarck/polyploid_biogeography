						<td>independentReplicationRateFromUmi<br />
						<td>Given the UMIs one can estimate the rate of biological duplication directly, as this would be the
 rate of having different UMIs in all duplicate sets. This is only a good estimate if the assumptions hold,
 for example if pSameUmiInIndependentBiDup is near 1.</td>
