		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Summary fingerprinting metrics and statistics about the comparison of the sequence data
 from a single read group (lane or index within a lane) vs. a set of known genotypes for
 the expected sample.

				<p>This table summarizes the values that are specific to this metric.</p>
				<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
					<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Metric</th>
						<th>Summary</th>
					</tr>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td>READ_GROUP<br />
						<td>The read group from which sequence data was drawn for comparison.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SAMPLE<br />
						<td>The sample whose known genotypes the sequence data was compared to.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>LL_EXPECTED_SAMPLE<br />
						<td>The Log Likelihood of the sequence data given the expected sample's genotypes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>LL_RANDOM_SAMPLE<br />
						<td>The Log Likelihood of the sequence data given a random sample from the human population.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>LOD_EXPECTED_SAMPLE<br />
						<td>The LOD for Expected Sample vs. Random Sample.  A positive LOD indicates that the sequence data
 is more likely to come from the expected sample vs. a random sample from the population, by LOD logs.
 I.e. a value of 6 indicates that the sequence data is 1,000,000 more likely to come from the expected
 sample than from a random sample.  A negative LOD indicates the reverse - that the sequence data is more
 likely to come from a random sample than from the expected sample.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HAPLOTYPES_WITH_GENOTYPES<br />
						<td>The number of haplotypes that had expected genotypes to compare to.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HAPLOTYPES_CONFIDENTLY_CHECKED<br />
						<td>The subset of genotyped haplotypes for which there was sufficient sequence data to
 confidently genotype the haplotype. Note: all haplotypes with sequence coverage contribute to the
 LOD score, even if they cannot be "confidently checked" individually.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HAPLOTYPES_CONFIDENTLY_MATCHING<br />
						<td>The subset of confidently checked haplotypes that match the expected genotypes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HET_AS_HOM<br />
						<td>num of hets, observed as homs with LOD > threshold</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HOM_AS_HET<br />
						<td>num of homs, observed as hets with LOD > threshold</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>HOM_AS_OTHER_HOM<br />
						<td>num of homs, observed as other homs with LOD > threshold</td>
					</tr>
