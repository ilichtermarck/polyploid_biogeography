		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Metrics that are calculated during the process of marking duplicates
 within a stream of SAMRecords.

				<p>This table summarizes the values that are specific to this metric.</p>
				<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
					<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Metric</th>
						<th>Summary</th>
					</tr>
					</thead>
					<tr>
						<td>LIBRARY<br />
						<td>The library on which the duplicate marking was performed.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>UNPAIRED_READS_EXAMINED<br />
						<td>The number of mapped reads examined which did not have a mapped mate pair,
 either because the read is unpaired, or the read is paired to an unmapped mate.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED<br />
						<td>The number of mapped read pairs examined. (Primary, non-supplemental)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SECONDARY_OR_SUPPLEMENTARY_RDS<br />
						<td>The number of reads that were either secondary or supplementary</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>UNMAPPED_READS<br />
						<td>The total number of unmapped reads examined. (Primary, non-supplemental)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>UNPAIRED_READ_DUPLICATES<br />
						<td>The number of fragments that were marked as duplicates.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES<br />
						<td>The number of read pairs that were marked as duplicates.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES<br />
						<td>The number of read pairs duplicates that were caused by optical duplication.
 Value is always < READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES, which counts all duplicates regardless of source.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>PERCENT_DUPLICATION<br />
						<td>The fraction of mapped sequence that is marked as duplicate.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ESTIMATED_LIBRARY_SIZE<br />
						<td>The estimated number of unique molecules in the library based on PE duplication.</td>
					</tr>
