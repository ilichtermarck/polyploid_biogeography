		<h2>Overview</h2>
		An error metric for the errors invovling bases in the overlapping region of a read-pair.
 The resulting metric includes error rate information which can be assigned to the reading
 of the molecular insert {@link #DISAGREES_WITH_REF_AND_MATE_ONLY_Q}, error rate which can be
 assigned to events that occured to to the molecular insert before it was loaded onto the
 flowcell/sequencer {@link #DISAGREES_WITH_REFERENCE_ONLY_Q}, and an error rate which
 cannot be explained nicely {@link #THREE_WAYS_DISAGREEMENT_ONLY_Q}.

				<p>This table summarizes the values that are specific to this metric.</p>
